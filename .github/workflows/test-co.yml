# This workflow has only one job, and it uses three Actions:
# - checkout@v2           is used to clone this enclosing repository
#                         (sdi-one-architecture/documentation-infrastructure essentially
#                         to retrieve the antora-playbook.yml file for Antora to use.
#                         Moving to v3 of this action is planned; in the meantime version v2 is
#                         still being used. 
#                         For v2 see: https://github.com/actions/checkout/archive/refs/tags/v2.zip
#                         For v3 see: https://github.com/actions/checkout
#
# - actions-gh-pages@v3   simplifies publishing the content generated by Antora into Github Pages,
#                         without the need for any manual setup of the repository.
#                         See: https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages
#
# - setup-node@v2         simplifies the installation of Node.js and the npm package manager. Moving 
#                         to v3.41 is planned, which uses checkout@v3 and setup-node@v3; in the meantime
#                         v2 is still being used.
#                         For v2 see: https://github.com/actions/setup-node
#                         For v3 see: https://github.com/actions/setup-node
